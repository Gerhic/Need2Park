We talked about parking and how the system is completely backwards for their clients. With strong interest and hate for the parking industry we decided to take a closer look. For our surprise, we found out that the parking lot owners also feel like the system is working against them, however they have no alternatives. It was right then and there we decided to get involved and redesign parking industry from the ground up. We focused on the problems that both parties had and came up with a solution that would be the best fir for both. We were not looking for a compromise, we were looking for a solution.\n";
